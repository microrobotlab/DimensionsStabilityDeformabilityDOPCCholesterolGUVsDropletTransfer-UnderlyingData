This repository contains the **Underlying data** of the brief report _"Dimensions, stability, and deformability of DOPC-cholesterol giant unilamellar vesicles formed by droplet transfer"_ by Roberti _et al._ published in **Open Research Europe** (DOI of current version: [10.12688/openreseurope.19149.2](https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.19149.2)).


## Data description

`Underlying data`  
&emsp;&#9492;`data\`: data files with GUVs dimensions (acquired in ImageJ)

&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_with_cholesterol_6040_1/2/3.csv`: dimensions of magnetic GUVs made from 60:40 DOPC:cholesterol LS under magnetic fields H1/H2/H3     
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_without_cholesterol_1/2/3.csv`: dimensions of magnetic GUVs made from 100:0 DOPC:cholesterol LS under magnetic fields H1/H2/H3    
&emsp;&#9492;`results\`: outputs from the data analysis  
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`Figure3.svg` and `Figure5.svg`: figures 3 and 5 of the article  
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUV_stability_T0_proc.csv` and `GUV_stability_ON_proc.csv`: processed data with diameter in &mu;m and surface area in &mu;m&sup2;  
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_stability_T0vsON.csv`: fitted distribution parameters and total surface area, pristine _vs_ overnight   
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_concentration_stability.csv`: _p_ values for differences between samples from LSs at different concentrations, pristine and overnight   
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_deformability_60_40.csv` and `GUVs_deformability_100_0.csv`: dimensions of magnetic GUVs made from 60:40 DOPC:cholesterol LS under magnetic fields with calculated geometrical parameters   
&emsp;&emsp;&#9492;`GUVs_concentration_stability.csv`: _p_ values for differences between samples with and without cholesterol in terms of size and deformability; minimum detectable effect size   
&emsp;&#9492;`utilities\magnetic_field.jl`: script for calculating the magnetic field generated by two permanent magnets  
&emsp;&#9492;`size_distribution_stability.jl`: main script for reproducing the data analysis related to size distribution and stability of GUVs  
&emsp;&#9492;`deformability.jl`: main script for reproducing the data analysis related to the deformability of GUVs  
&emsp;&#9492;`Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml`: computational environment files  
&emsp;&#9492;`_init_.jl`: utility script for reproducing the computational environment  


### Computational analysis

The analysis is performed in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), v1.10.
Once the correct version of Julia is installed, the computational environment including all specific dependencies can be exactly reproduced thanks to the utility script `_init_.jl` and the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files.

The analysis scripts also generate some of the **Extended Data**. 

#### Instruction for reproducing the analysis

1. Install Julia (see [https://julialang.org/install/](https://julialang.org/install/)): the specific version 1.10 can be installed via `juliaup`
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Start the Julia REPL with Julia 1.10 from the local repository directory
4. Run the utility script `_init_.jl`
5. Run the `size_distribution_stability.jl` and `deformability.jl` scripts
